__A store for old and "un-fun" games I've developed.__

# Dragon
- Game based around the two concept words "Dragon" and "Ale".
- Bad gameplay meets horrible MSPaint graphics, but lots of lessons learnt.

# Emberboy
- Built on the concept of avoiding the rain.
- Fire sprite character would extinguish with each hit.
